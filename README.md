# üëã Introduction
Thank you for the opportunity to work on this challenge. I appreciate the thought and effort that went into crafting (and strategically breaking) this project.

The brief has tasked me with achieving the following objectives:

## Main Objectives
- ‚úÖ Find and refactor an intermittent glitch affecting player experience, from BP->CPP without functionality loss
- ‚úÖ Build and Package for Windows
- ‚úÖ Test the build to verify the issues(s) have been rectified

## Additional Objectives
- ‚úÖ Create and maintain a Git repository with regular commits and comments
- ‚úÖ Upload packaged Windows executable
- ‚úÖ Document the development process (this document)


While the individual problems were not deeply complex, they effectively demonstrate how a developer navigates Unreal Engine internals, debugging methodology, and architectural awareness‚Äîespecially within larger or more dynamic projects.

# üìì Approach and Methodology
## Initial Diagnosis
My first steps were to familiarise myself with the project and its directory structure. This allowed me to gain a basic overview of how assets have been organised, as well as identify any potential targets for clues to resolving the problem.

## Debugging Techniques

- Examine debug logs thoroughly
- Take note of comments and tasks in code files
- Identify potential blueprint issues and poor coding principles
- Use tools like Profiling and Insights as well as command line level tools like `stat` do determine consistent performance drops

Upon reviewing crash, debug and build logs as well as look into `Saved` and `Intermediate` assets, I had ascertained some assets that I would review first:

### Assets to review (12):

## Step-by-Step Recovery
### 1. Delete temporary directories
Fresh start without importing too many broken things. `Saved`, `Intermediate` and `DerivedDataCache` can all be rebuilt based on the data in `Contents` and `Source` etc.

### 2. Commit the project to git in its initial state
This way we can track all the changes we make. We can omit temporary directories to reduce repo size and improve portability.

### 3. Open the project in Visual Studio
Cleaning and rebuilding will reveal any potential issues that might prevent the project from opening in the Editor. 

### 4. Missing Code ***[Issue #1]***
Due to missing code in [`LyraActorUtilities.cpp`](Source/LyraGame/System/LyraActorUtilities.cpp), the compile failed. Fortunately the file referenced a dropbox link where the code may be obtained.

### 5. Redundant Code ***[Issue #2]***
[`LyraAnimInstance.cpp`](Source/LyraGame/Animation/LyraAnimInstance.cpp) was triggering `MipGenSettings` on `CreateTransient` 2d textures. This is redundant as these do not generate mipmaps on runtime. The code was commented out.

### 6. Invalid Variable Initializations ***[Issue #3]***
[`LyraCharacter.h`](Source/LyraGame/Character/LyraCharacter.h) and [`SCircumferenceMarkerWidget.h`](Source/LyraGame/UI/Weapons/SCircumferenceMarkerWidget.h) both have code which fails to initialize variables properly.

### 7. Remove Unused Plugin ***[Issue #4]***
The GBSNats plugin, which allows for integration with the NATS.io service,  will be removed because it is:
- only for Linux
- not being used in the project

### 8. Unperformant Blueprint Code ***[Issue #5]***
The brief created the task of identifying the hitch in gameplay as well as refactoring the blueprint code into C++.

Unreal Profiler and Insights were used in additional to play-testing with `stat` to identify and trace the problematic execution flow which was incurring a substantial performance cost on the tick time.

#### Functionality Overview

When the user overlaps a `B_WeaponsSpawner` or `B_AbilitySpawner` (child class of the former), a blueprint event `Calculate Items Ammo Count` is fired. This event generates a random integer between 1000 and 100000 and feeds it into a blueprint function called `Item Power Calculator`. 

This function is essentially a Fibonacci Number Generator, however the high input values for `n` cause an integer overflow (presumably intended), which causes an initial hitch in the gameplay.

> ü§ì In short, C++ code for this same functionality will incur less code loops vs the Blueprint Virtual Machine (BVM) by a factor of 2-3x, resulting in faster execution time.

#### Changes

The following C++ Blueprint Function Library was created:
- `ItemPowerCalculator.cpp`
- `ItemPowerCalculator.h`

The following blueprints were affected:

- `B_WeaponSpawner.uasset`
- `B_AbilitySpawner.uasset`

The following changes were applied:

- Deleted the blueprint function for `Item Power Calculator`
- Updated the blueprint event `Calculate Items Ammo Count` to call the new C++-based replacement function `ItemPowerCalculator`

#### Insights

Profiler data captured to identify the execution flow and potential source of the problem:

Play-testing as well as running Profiling and Insights tools revealed that the changes were effective:

#### The project was successfully cooked, compiled and built for Windows x64 platform.

# ü§ì Reflections and Recommendations

The conversion of blueprint logic to C++ significantly improved performance and clarity. However, with deeper architectural context, additional improvements could be made:

## File Organization
The Blueprint Function Library could be relocated to a more appropriate module‚Äîe.g., Calculators/ItemCalculators, better aligned with domain-specific logic.
>eg. if multiple item calculators will be created, the blueprint function library might be called `ItemCalculators` and/or placed in a `calculators` directory within the `Item Calculators` meta category.

## Full C++ Transition
The Calculate Items Ammo Count event can be migrated to C++ for full native execution.
```cpp
//header file
int32 RandomValue = UKismetMathLibrary::RandomIntegerInRange(1000, 100000);
int32 AmmoCount = UItemPowerCalculator::ItemPowerCalculator(RandomValue);

//cpp file
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="Weapons")
void CalculateItemsAmmoCount();
```
## Input Validation
Future-proofing the Fibonacci function with basic input checks improves code robustness and debuggability (assuming this is the desired functionality).
```cpp
int32 UItemPowerCalculator::ItemPowerCalculator(int32 n)
{
    //don't allow negative n's
    if (n < 0)
    {
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("ItemPowerCalculator called with negative n: %d"), n);
        return 0; // or optionally: return -1;
    }

    int32 a = 0;
    int32 b = 1; //standard Fibonacci implementation 0 -> 1
    int32 c = 0;

    for (int32 i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }

    return c;
}
```
